; NATURAL LANGUAGE PROOF

Let ps be a list of prime numbers
Let n = (product ps) + 1

By prime-factor existence,
there is a prime p that divides n

Suppose p is in ps.
Then p divides (product ps).

Summary:
p divides (product ps)
p divides n

suppose that for any numbers a,b,c, (with b > c)
(and (divides a b) (divides a c))
then there exists witnesses k, m,
st
ak = b
am = c
so
ak - am = b - c
a(k - m) = b - c
so a divides (b - c)

applying this to
p divides (product ps)
p divides n
we get
p divides (difference n (product ps)) = 1

p divides 1
there exists q st
pq = 1
if q = 0, then pq = 0
so q > 0
but then pq >= p > 1
pq = 1 and pq > 1
contradiction

Summary of previous part:
(p in ps) implies contradiction
so p is not in ps
p is prime

so for any finite set of primes ps,
there is a prime p not in ps,
so the set of primes is not equal to ps,
so the set of primes is infinite,
